## But First, review yesterday's workshop

## GET

`GET` requests are meant to _fetch_ data from ...
it serves static content

---

The service initiating the request is usually a _browser_, or some sort of frontend that needs the data at this endpoint.

As we've seen `GET` can also submit date, but this data is sent via query parameters.

```
GET 200 /handleData?firstName=Homer&password=doh_wtf
```

---

`GET` requests are not secure, in the sense that any data sent with the request is

- visible all along its merry way to the server
- cached in browser history.

_In the context of Node, the `get` is our server answering a simple request for information._

---

## POST

- `POST` requests are meant to submit data to the server as well.
- `POST` submits data as part of the request object. Hence, the use of `req.body` in our code.

body obj have whatevr you set up from the front end
node server will analyze then sends what it knows

but they also expect something in return. Sometimes it's data, and sometimes it's simply an 'OK' from the service that it received the information.
